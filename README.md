**"what drives reef change?"**

The "Health Card" summarizes the status of the local reef/watershed for the public.

* health cards may have two versions:
    1. simplified print version
    2. more detailed on-line version more akin to infographiq infographics
* how to display data for villagers to understand?
* users have low education level
* some online & print card from that
* 1-pager printout "this is your watershed" & summary
* NMSAS divided into multiple areas (unlike other NMS).
    * one per "Health Card" for management areas
    * 26 areas total, starting w/ 2

NMSAS data collected for this:
* water quality (monthly @ streams)
