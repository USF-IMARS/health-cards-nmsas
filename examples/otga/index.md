You will need permissions to edit here, please send me your github username
(via email or github issue) and I will grant you edit permission here.

Please do not hesitate to create a new file in this directory and copy-paste
things from other examples or pages.
All changes can be easily rolled-back and it is very difficult to break.

If something doesn't work or you have a question, just let me know via email
or open an issue using the "issues" tab on github.
