This repo is an IMaRS-tech group project designed to explore markdown,
jekyll, Rmd, jupyter, and other technologies to help address Specific
Condition Report Questions (SCRQs).

See [./pages/](pages) for files addressing each of the SCRQs sections
from the 2018 CR Guidance document (pg 7). See [./examples/](examples)
for demonstrations of various technologies and data sources.
